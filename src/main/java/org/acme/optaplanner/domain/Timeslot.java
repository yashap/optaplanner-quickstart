/**
 * The Timeslot class represents a time interval when lessons are taught, for example, Monday 10:30 - 11:30 or Tuesday
 * 13:30 - 14:30. For simplicityâ€™s sake, all time slots have the same duration and there are no time slots during lunch
 * or other breaks.
 *
 * A time slot has no date, because a high school schedule just repeats every week.
 *
 * Because no Timeslot instances change during solving, a Timeslot is called a problem fact. Problem facts require no
 * OptaPlanner specific annotations.

/**
 * During a lesson, represented by the Lesson class, a teacher teaches a subject to a group of students, for example,
 * Math by A.Turing for 9th grade or Chemistry by M.Curie for 10th grade. If a subject is taught multiple times per week
 * by the same teacher to the same student group, there are multiple Lesson instances that are only distinguishable by
 * id. For example, the 9th grade has six math lessons a week.
 *
 * During solving, OptaPlanner changes the timeslot and room fields of the Lesson class, to assign each lesson to a time
 * slot and a room. Because OptaPlanner changes these fields, Lesson is a planning entity.
 *
 * A lessonâ€™s timeslot and room fields are unassigned (null) in the input data and assigned (not null) in the output
 * data. OptaPlanner changes these fields during solving. Such fields are called planning variables. In order for
 * OptaPlanner to recognize them, both the timeslot and room fields require an @PlanningVariable annotation. Their
 * containing class, Lesson, requires an @PlanningEntity annotation.
